# README

TODO list:

Front End 

* Are we going to have different styles for File Monitor and RJMC?
* Add localization
* Add Travis CI?
* Add Footer?
* Look into passwords
* Review UI: host, task_name, pattern, switch source and target?
* Conditional switch between username/password and access keys in UI
  we can still use username/password, or can add access_key_id, secret_access_key
  to task table
* modify Files part of UI: nested table instead of inspect, fix sizing 
* add SymmetricEncryption/ SecretConfig
* How to clean up jobs? I had to go in rails console, otherwise I would have to remove 500 FileMonitorJobs one by one.
